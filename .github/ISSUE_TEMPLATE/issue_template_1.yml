# 這段 issue template 是來自 imgui 的 issue template，我覺得這是不錯的範例
# issue template 可以使用 yml 撰寫，也可以使用 markdown

# 描述 issue template 的名稱以及描述，會顯示在 github issues 頁面下
name: "Ask a question, report a bug, request a feature, etc."
description: "Ask any question, discuss best practices, report a bug, request a feature."

# issue 模板的主要內容都寫在 body 內
body:
  - type: markdown # 這個欄位的格式是甚麼? 是個 markdown 的段落，value 內容可使用 markdown 語法
    attributes: # 該欄位的屬性
      value: | # 文字內容

        For anything else: we are happy to use 'GitHub Issues' for many types of open-ended questions. We are encouraging 'Issues' becoming a large, centralized and cross-referenced database of Dear ImGui contents.

When requesting a new feature, please describe the usage context (how you intend to use it, why you need it, etc.). If you tried something and it failed, show us what you tried.

      description: "Provide an [MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) to demonstrate your problem. An ideal submission includes a small piece of code that anyone can paste into one of the examples applications (examples/*/main.cpp) or the demo (imgui_demo.cpp) to understand and reproduce it. Narrowing your problem to its shortest and purest form is the easiest way to understand it, explain it and fix it. Please test your shortened code to ensure it exhibits the problem. Often while creating the MCVE you will solve the problem! Many questions that are missing a standalone verifiable example are missing the actual cause of their issue in the description, which ends up wasting everyone's time."
